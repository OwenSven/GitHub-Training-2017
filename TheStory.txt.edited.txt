Mr. Simons and The Squirrel: A Short Story

Once upon a time, there was a man who convinced the others to call him
Mr. Simons. He was a kind man, especially to those he did not despise. He
was especially kind to the love of his life: The Squirrel.

One day, Mr. Simons found the Squirrel dead. He was heart-broken and no longer knew what to do without the love of his life. After mourning for a few weeks, Mr. Simons decided that the only way to do The Squirrelâ€™s life justice was to have a beautiful funeral. Over the next few months Mr. Simons was hard at work organizing and planning the funeral up to its very last detail. The day came and it was much harder than Mr.Simons thought it to be.
